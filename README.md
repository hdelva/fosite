# foseti

Forseti, or Fosite as he was known in Frisia, is a pre-Christian Norse god. 
It’s said that he settles disputes in his dwelling-place, Glitnir. 
He thus seems to be the divine equivalent of and model for the human “lawspeaker”, 
the ceremonial head of the þing, the Germanic legal assembly. 
It is said that his is the best of courts; all those who come before him leave reconciled.
